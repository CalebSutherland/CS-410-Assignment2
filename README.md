Team Members: Caleb Sutherland, Ezana Esayas


New Effects Added:

Sound Effect: We added a "monster sound" that triggers when you get within close proximity to a gorgoyle.

Linear Interpolation: Changed the gargoyle's flashlight color depending on how far the player is.

Particle Effect: Added a particle system to the John Lemon character that activates while the player is moving

Dot Product: Attempted to have the ghosts rotate to face the player as they move but it seems like the animations are effecting it
